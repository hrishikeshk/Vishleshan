PURPOSE :

This is an overall design statement for a Red Black Tree implementation
suitable for use as an index into a linear storage container.

Introduction :

	This RBTree implementation uses 4 byte integers (offsets) as links to 
parent and child nodes instead of pointers. Also, only 4 byte offsets that
reference objects in a list are stored in the index and satellite data for
the objects is neither stored nor copied. 

The way to use this index is as follows:

1/ Create your own list of objects, that includes all satellite data that you
need to store along with some indentifying (key) attribute of those objects.

2/ Create a new class that inherits from the class 'Key' and implements a
function compare(). This class should maintain references to the list of
objects and one actual key attribute. The function compare() should use the
passed offset and the referenced list to first find the object to compare
with, and then do the comparison.

3/ Use the Key and RBTree interfaces to insert objects into the index after
saving each one at some offset in your list.

4/ To search for objects, create an object of sub-type of 'Key' and use the
RBTree interface to locate the offset of the object in your list.

Dependencies :
	1/ std::vector<> available with the Boost Library.
	2/ Tested on CentOS Linux 64-bit OS, gcc 4.4.7, but this should work
elsewhere.


Public Interfaces :

	This indexing functionality has two interfaces that are to be utilized by the client classes.
	1/ Key : The Key is an abstract class that is designed to serve as the base class for Keys defined by the client classes. The client class must implement the function compare() and return the result of comparison with whatever key is passed as input argument. 

		virtual Key::RBStatus compare(UInt32 cmp_ox) = 0;

	2/ RBTree : Offers functions to insert uniquely an object's offset in
a RBTree, finding the objects already stored and also deletion.

Static Data Model :

	The class 'Key' does not store any member data.

	The class 'RBNode' serves as the node of the Red Black tree and needs
to save data necessary for RBTree algorithms. There are 4 pieces of
information saved here : enum color and 4-byte offsets for parent, left and
right child nodes. Finally an offset representing the client's data is also
stored.

	The class 'RBTree' saves the information about the offset of the root
of the tree. Secondly, it also saves a vector of RBNodes.


Dynamic Data Model :

	The standard algorithms for implementation of the RBTree are to be
followed. 
	The integrated indexing framework implies this flow :
	Insertion -
	a/ Take a Key and an offset to be inserted uniquely into the RBTree.
	b/ Invoke the Key::compare() and pass the offset encountered with
RBNodes already saved in the index. Depending on what is returned, traverse to
left or right child node in the RBTree. If the Key is not unique, return
appropiately. Else insert the offset passed in RBTree using the standard algorithm when the
traveral reaches the sentinel 'NIL' node.

	Search -
	Searching uses the same steps as insertion, and again uses the same
compare() invocations to traverse to the desired node. The offset stored with
the RBNode is returned.


Unit Tests :

	The unit testing should do a systematic insertion of a permutation of
objects into the tree to test insertion and then deletion again in permutation. The number of objects permuted for this test should be all numbers in the range [1-7]. The result verification should happen after each RBTree operation.

	The insertion and deletion steps should then happen for 
interleavings between insert and delete operations. 

Benchmarks : TODO
